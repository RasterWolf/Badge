Build Sytem Linux:
SConstruct build system. It will have a makefile in the future. 

Build System Windows:
Visual Studio 2017 Community edition. Please note that you have to set up the C++ directories in the solution. I have moved include files to mimic the file structure in linux. Currently tested in x86, I don't know if x64 works. 

Getting this up and running will require C++ and linux knowledge.
